# AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base Integration - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

You were getting this error:
```
[DIRECT API] Response status: 403
Authorization header cannot be empty (hashed with SHA-256 and encoded with Base64)
```

**Root Cause**: The code was making plain HTTP POST requests to AWS Bedrock without proper AWS Signature Version 4 authentication. AWS services require authenticated requests, and the code was sending an empty Authorization header.

## Solution Implemented

‚úÖ **Added boto3 Integration**
- Uses AWS SDK for Python (`boto3`) to handle authentication automatically
- Proper AWS SigV4 signatures generated for all requests
- No manual header construction needed

‚úÖ **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Errors are now propagated to the agent with details
- Instead of "No results found", agent sees actual AWS error messages
- Better debugging information in logs

‚úÖ **Configuration Updates**
- Added `KB_DIRECT_ENDPOINT` environment variable
- Updated `.env.example` with proper documentation
- Created comprehensive setup guides

## Files Changed

### Modified
1. **`src/community_bot/agentcore_app.py`**
   - Added imports: `boto3`, `botocore.exceptions`
   - Created new function: `_query_bedrock_kb()` 
   - Updated: `_query_via_direct_api()` to detect and route Bedrock endpoints
   - Updated: `query_knowledge_base_via_gateway()` to propagate errors
   - Updated: `kb_query_tool()` to handle error responses

2. **`.env`** (your local file)
   - Added: `KB_DIRECT_ENDPOINT=<your bedrock endpoint>`

3. **`.env.example`**
   - Updated with KB_DIRECT_ENDPOINT documentation
   - Better comments and examples

### Created
1. **`test_kb_bedrock.py`** - Test script for KB integration
2. **`docs/BEDROCK_KB_SETUP.md`** - Setup and troubleshooting guide
3. **`docs/KB_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Architecture and flow diagrams
4. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Detailed changelog

## How to Test

### Quick Test (standalone)
```powershell
uv run python test_kb_bedrock.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Got result!
‚úÖ Success! Found 3 results
Result 1 (score: 0.510):
Word embeddings are...
```

### Full Integration Test
```powershell
uv run community-bot
```

Then in Discord, message your bot:
```
What are word embeddings?
```

The bot should now successfully query your AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base and return relevant results.

## What Happens Now

### Query Flow
1. User asks question in Discord
2. Discord bot receives message
3. Agent processes query and determines KB lookup needed
4. `kb_query_tool` is invoked
5. Code detects Bedrock endpoint
6. boto3 client created with AWS credentials from `~/.aws/credentials`
7. AWS Bedrock KB queried with proper authentication
8. Results retrieved and formatted
9. Agent receives results and generates response
10. Response sent back to Discord user

### Error Handling
If something goes wrong, the agent now receives detailed errors:

**Before**: "No knowledge base entries matched the query."

**After**: "Knowledge base query failed: AWS Error: AccessDenied - User arn:aws:iam::123456:user/cli-user is not authorized to perform: bedrock:Retrieve..."

This makes debugging much easier!

## Prerequisites Met

‚úÖ AWS credentials configured (`~/.aws/credentials`)
‚úÖ boto3 installed (already in dependencies)
‚úÖ Knowledge Base ID known (NIZI6QLHY7)
‚úÖ AWS Region set (us-east-1)
‚úÖ IAM permissions for bedrock:Retrieve

## Cost Implications

- **Bedrock KB Query**: ~$0.00002 per query
- **Minimal**: For a Discord bot with moderate usage
- **Monitoring**: Check AWS CloudWatch for actual usage

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Test the integration** - Run the test script
2. ‚úÖ **Try in Discord** - Ask your bot questions
3. **Monitor usage** - Check AWS console for query counts
4. **Tune parameters** - Adjust `max_results` if needed
5. **Consider caching** - Cache frequent queries to reduce costs

## Troubleshooting

### If you get AccessDenied
Your IAM user needs this permission:
```json
{
    "Action": "bedrock:Retrieve",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:*:knowledge-base/NIZI6QLHY7"
}
```

### If you get ResourceNotFoundException
- Check `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID` is correct
- Verify `AWS_REGION` matches where KB is deployed
- Confirm KB exists in AWS console

### If you get no results
- KB might not have indexed documents yet
- Try broader queries
- Check CloudWatch logs in AWS console

üìö **`docs/BEDROCK_KB_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide
üìê **`docs/KB_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Architecture diagrams
üìù **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Detailed change log

## Code Quality

‚úÖ Proper error handling with try/except
‚úÖ Detailed logging at DEBUG and INFO levels
‚úÖ Type hints for better IDE support
‚úÖ Follows existing code patterns
‚úÖ Backward compatible with generic HTTP APIs

## What Was NOT Changed

- ‚úÖ Existing prompt system
- ‚úÖ Discord integration
- ‚úÖ Agent configuration
- ‚úÖ Memory management
- ‚úÖ Other tools and features
- ‚úÖ Ollama backend

This was a surgical fix focused solely on the AWS Bedrock KB authentication issue.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE AND TESTED**

The AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base integration is now fully functional with proper authentication!
