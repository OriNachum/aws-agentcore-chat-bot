I want to design a system for adding source agents to the bot knowledge.
This means means processes that run in background and collect data to s3

An agent may just be a script, it may be connected to database, or use AI agent for collecting data. (Strands, MCP, browser use, for example.)

Definition of done is a document in docs/plan/sub-agents.md file
