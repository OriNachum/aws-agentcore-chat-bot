Of course, here is a design document for your Discord bot.

### **1. Overview**

This document outlines the design for a Discord bot that uses an AI agent built with **Amazon Strands** and **AWS AgentCore**. The bot will monitor a specific, hardcoded channel for user messages and provide intelligent responses generated by the AI agent. The agent's knowledge will be supplemented by a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, where documents can be regularly uploaded to an S3 bucket and indexed by AgentCore for the agent to query.

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a functional demonstration and test of AWS AgentCore's capabilities, particularly its RAG integration and ability to serve a Strands-based agent.

### **2. System Architecture**

The system is composed of four main components: the Discord Bot, an API Gateway, an AWS Lambda function, and the AWS AgentCore-hosted Strands Agent.


1.  **Discord Bot**: The bot is a Python application running on a server (or potentially another Lambda function) that connects to the Discord API. It listens for messages in the designated channel.
2.  **API Gateway**: This service provides an HTTP endpoint that the Discord bot can call. It routes requests to the AWS Lambda function.
3.  **AWS Lambda**: A serverless function that acts as the intermediary between the Discord bot and the AI agent. It receives the user's message from the API Gateway, invokes the AgentCore runtime, and sends the agent's response back to the Discord bot.
4.  **AWS AgentCore & Strands Agent**:
    * **AgentCore Runtime**: A secure, serverless environment that hosts and executes the Strands agent. It handles the session management and scaling of the agent.
    * **AgentCore Memory**: Manages the conversational history (short-term memory) and, through RAG, long-term knowledge.
    * **S3 Bucket**: Stores the documents for the RAG knowledge base. AgentCore will automatically index new files uploaded here.
    * **Strands Agent**: The core logic of the AI, written in Python using the Strands SDK. It processes the user's prompt, queries the knowledge base via RAG if necessary, and generates a response.

### **3. Component Breakdown**

#### **a. Discord Bot**

* **Library**: **discord.py** is a popular and well-documented Python library for building Discord bots.
* **Functionality**:
    * On startup, the bot will connect to Discord using a secure token.
    * It will listen for `on_message` events exclusively in the hardcoded channel ID.
    * To prevent the bot from replying to its own messages, it will ignore messages sent by itself.
    * When a user posts a message, the bot will make an HTTPS POST request to the API Gateway endpoint, sending the message content in the request body.
    * It will wait for the response from the API and then post the received text back to the Discord channel.

#### **b. AWS Backend**

* **API Gateway & Lambda**:
    * A REST API will be created in API Gateway with a single `/chat` endpoint that accepts POST requests.
    * This endpoint will be integrated with a Python-based AWS Lambda function.
    * The Lambda function will use the **Boto3** (AWS SDK for Python) to interact with the `bedrock-agentcore` client.
    * It will be responsible for invoking the agent runtime, passing the user's message, and returning the agent's response.

* **AWS AgentCore for RAG**:
    * AgentCore provides a managed RAG solution. You will need to configure a **Knowledge Base** within Amazon Bedrock.
    * This Knowledge Base will be pointed to your S3 bucket.
    * You can set it to automatically synchronize and re-index the data whenever new files are added to the S3 bucket.
    * The Strands agent can then be given access to this Knowledge Base as a "tool," allowing it to perform semantic searches over your documents to answer questions.

* **Amazon Strands Agent**:
    * The agent itself will be a Python application using the `strands-agents` library.
    * It will have a "system prompt" defining its persona and primary function.
    * It will be configured to use a powerful foundation model available through Amazon Bedrock (e.g., Anthropic's Claude).
    * The agent will be given the AgentCore-managed RAG Knowledge Base as a tool, enabling it to answer questions based on the content of the files in S3.
    * The agent code is packaged into a container image and deployed to the AgentCore Runtime.

### **4. Libraries and Tools**

* **Programming Language**: Python 3.10+
* **Discord Bot**:
    * `discord.py`: For interacting with the Discord API.
    * `requests` or `aiohttp`: For making HTTP requests to the API Gateway.
* **AWS Backend (Lambda & Agent)**:
    * `boto3`: The AWS SDK for Python, used to invoke AgentCore.
    * `strands-agents`: The SDK for building the AI agent.
    * `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit`: For deploying the agent to AgentCore.
* **Infrastructure as Code (Recommended)**:
    * **AWS CDK**: To define and deploy the AWS resources (Lambda, API Gateway, S3 bucket, IAM roles) in a repeatable way. The sample repositories heavily utilize CDK.
